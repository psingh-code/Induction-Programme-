The most awaited day had come! During these 2 months (June - July), there wasn't a corner of the college's website I hadn't visited. All the insta pages, club sites, everything I could find about my upcoming journey, I had devoured heartily. From getting tense during the admission process to preparing and packing up for the first day, I was ready. I woke up early in the morning, as a matter of habit, but today there was glitter of enthusiasm in my eyes. Waking up wasn't tiring, exciting I'd rather say. What to wear, which turban to tie, I had already decided the night before.

With the blessings of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, my parents, my grandmother and best wishes from my friends and sibling, I left my home, boarded an auto and reached the front gate of the college in under 5 mins. Did I mention that I just lived around 1.5 kms away from the college? Well now you know! I met my school friend there and headed inside. Upon reaching the Gurudwara Sahib we both were in awe at what we saw. The Gurudwara Sahib's shape was peculiar, which we later came to know was designed like a SHIP. This is to illustrate the line " Guru Nanak Naam Jahaz Hai, Chadai So Utre Paar". 

We did Japji Sahib Paath there, listened to the melodious kirtan by the Raagi Jatha, and payed attention to the teachings given by the Granthi Sahib. Then we had Langar and walked over to the auditorium where upon receiving our kits, sat separately with our respective branches. 

Through the words of addressal by the Principal Sir, we came to know about the esteemed legacy of the college and how lucky we were to have joined during the ongoing Platinum Jubilee year. Then we were introduced to Ex. Prof Singh, whose words were filled with wisdome and the experience of a lifetime. He asked us to always keep in mind the name the college is based on  -  Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and I will do so. 

Then came Mr. Maheshinder Singh, a renowned politician and lawyer who taught us the value of hardwork,determination and how we have an opportunity to design our lives. 

Our HOD Harpreet Mam's speech felt so warm, similar to how a mother guides her child. I immensely respect her from my heart. 

This marked the end of the day. I went home content, awaiting the next day.

Today started off with a warm welcome by Harpreet mam, who told us to settle down, ignore the hustle-bustle and focus on ourselves, and recite any mantra or verse of whatever religion/faith we follow. 

Mrs. Priyadarshini ( a PhD holder in ECE) hosted the first session. She made me realize how little I focused on being _continuously_ happy and rather thought of _excitation_ as real happiness. Also she taught us how we can *choose* to be angry or calm just by changing our perspective, which once I exercised, helped me calm myself down. I found this particular subject quite engrossing.

Then came Mr. Arvind Dhingra, who literally woke up all of us again with his energetic and relatable way of talking. The ice-breaker exercise helped me make a new friend. The whole session was amazing and we all wished it to be longer. 

The English Proficiency Test went by like a breeze, while the maths one scratched some desolate corners of my brain which made me ponder on my weak memory. Although I did solve most of the questions, some proved to be rather tricky, involving formulas we had already used in the past, but failed to recall at the moment. 

With the tests done, and the question paper in my hand, I walked out of the college's front gate, boarded an auto and reached home, determined to work harder to improve my maths aptitude.

 Even before joining the college, I was very curious about all the clubs and societies here. Today's first session was held by "CAUSMIC CLUB". The speakers shared with us the history of the club, how it came into formation and gave a detailed overview of the various events hosted by the club, APEX and AMBIT YOUTH PARLIAMENT grabbing my attention the most. The _Bhaisaab reel_ was quite funny and showed us how the clubs use various forms of approach to convey their messages and ideas. I might apply for the club once the forms are out.

 Mrs. Priyadarshini's second session was as intriguing as the last one. Everything she spoke felt like was targeted towards me. She understands the youth on deeper level than most speakers. Her views on the indulgence-depression cycle resonated with me. I asked her some of my queries once the session ended, and her answers were extremely helpful. Then I went on to meet some sophomores I personally knew who took me around the campus and shared their experiences with me.

 After the break ended, I headed towards my assigned class room for my first English lecture, which to my surprise was more of a two-way discussion than a traditional lecture. Prof. Nisha asked all of us to introduce ourselves. She complimented me on my confident posture (but deep down I knew I could do better, if only I had more confidence and lesser stage fear). I took note of all her advices and noted them down. I will surely join the English Club to work on my English Communication Skills which have gotten way worse since the last 2 years.

 Next up, we had our first P2P (Peer to Peer) lecture in the same room, for which I brought my laptop too. Our seniors taught us the basics of C++. Although I didn't quite understand the theory part first, but when I ran the code on an online compiler for the first time, it all made sense. I wasnt able to execute the _sum_ function properly though, so asked help from one of the seniors, who gladly helped me and cleared all the doubts.

Today was an amazing and enlightening experience and I look forward for more such instances.

The time-table for today's program was quite different and I had to recheck thrice to confirm that I was reading the correct one. We had our first class at 1:30 pm which was a P2P session again, with our senior Manan Sood. It was substantially different from the last one as instead of learning to code, we were given advice on how to make out the best of the upcoming semesters. Manan himself shared his mistakes and advised us to work in a focused and smart way, while taking part in clubs and various activites, managing studies and activities efficiently. He also took all of our queries and answered them. I came to know the college better today.

Next up we went to the auditorium and enjoyed an amazing lecture on _Motorsports_ by Mr. Gautam Murria. I didn't even know that the power saver mode I use on my phone on a daily basis is a result of motorsports innovation. He explained how motorsports requires engineers from each and every branch of engineering. 

The program continued with a session by Dr. Shaffy Makkar with her expert lecture on "Millets - A Super Food". I didn't even know I was cooking them the incorrect way. No wonder they couldn't appeal to my taste buds. She showed us the correct method to make them which I noted down to share with my mom. When she was listing and explaining the different types of millets and their respective benefits, _Kutki_ catched my eye since it is beneficial for women over 40 years of age going through menopause, which I intend to cook for my mother. The session was quite eye-opening for me and I cant wait to try millets now.

Today's program's commencement time was bit late than usual i.e. 9:30 instead of 8:30, so I used that extra time to work on this report.

The day kicked off by a lecture by the Dean of Student Welfare - Dr. Parminder Singh, who made us familiar with all the facilities available in the college like computer labs, high speed wifi, swimming pool, emergency medical aid, central library etc. and asked us to utilize them to the fullest. He also warned us against ragging since the college has a very strick Anti-Ragging policy which ensures a healthy and collaborative environment for everyone to grow.

The program proceeded with a lecture from a personality who I greatly admire now - Mr. Manpreet Singh, who is a professional body builder and also the SARPANCH of Manakwal village. Such a contrast in professions led my interest to peak in the lecture, and I was quite amazed by what was coming. He shared with us his story, from rags to success, how his unbreakable will led him through highs and lows. He stressesd on the importance of fitness for us future engineers. Not only that, as a big brother too he made us promise never to get into drug addiction and help out anyone we can. The most interesting part of the session was when he called a bunch of boys to perform push ups on the stage. The whole auditorium, including me were cheering for them. I wish to have the same determination as him and pave my way towards my dream.

What followed next was nothing short of inspiring. Were introduced to the college's NCC wing by one of the Under-Officers. He showed us all the past events, the social media pages and how the NCC has been an integral part of the college's culture. Then we welcomed Brigadier P.S. Cheema Sir with a standing ovation followed by a huge round of applause. He stressed upon the importance of discipline for students and how consistency is must-have skill for the youth to be successful. Before ending, he taught us the 5 F's of success. Then he left the auditorium, addressing us by " Young boys and girls, ALL THE BEST". I aspire to have even 10 percent of the discipline NCC cadets have.

Prof. Jaspreet Singh hosted our first physics lecture. He explained to us the curriculum of first year and how we should study to gain both practical and theoretical knowdledge in the best way possible. Nevertheless, he cleared all my queries regarding the subject in general too.

We had our 3rd P2P lecture after Physics, where seniors continued teaching us C++, this time more advanced topics such as operators, looping and conditional statements. We created more complex codes than last time using all the new knowledge we had gained during today's lecture. Everything was crystal clear. The seniors asked us to prepare for the upcoming P2P exam and wished us all the best.

This ended a hectic day, but my mind was not tired as I got to learn what I want to. Day by day, I move one step closer towards my dream.
