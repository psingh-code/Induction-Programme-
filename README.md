# Day - 1 :- INAUGURATION - TO NEW BEGINNINGS
## 30 July, 2025
The most awaited day had come! During these 2 months (June - July), there wasn't a corner of the college's website I hadn't visited. All the insta pages, club sites, everything I could find about my upcoming journey, I had devoured heartily. From getting tense during the admission process to preparing and packing up for the first day, I was ready. I woke up early in the morning, as a matter of habit, but today there was glitter of enthusiasm in my eyes. Waking up wasn't tiring, exciting I'd rather say. What to wear, which turban to tie, I had already decided the night before.

With the blessings of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, my parents, my grandmother and best wishes from my friends and sibling, I left my home, boarded an auto and reached the front gate of the college in under 5 mins. Well I live just around a km away from the institute so travel was a breeze for me. I met my school friend there and headed inside. Upon reaching the Gurudwara Sahib we both were in awe at what we saw. The Gurudwara Sahib's shape was peculiar, which we later came to know was designed like a SHIP. This is to illustrate the line " Guru Nanak Naam Jahaz Hai, Chadai So Utre Paar".

We did Japji Sahib Paath there, listened to the melodious and soulful kirtan by the Raagi Jatha, and payed attention to the teachings given by the Granthi Sahib. Then we had Langar and walked over to the auditorium where upon receiving our kits, sat separately with our respective branches. 

Through the words of addressal by the Principal Sir, we came to know about the esteemed legacy of the college and how lucky we were to have joined during the ongoing Platinum Jubilee year. Then we were introduced to Ex. Prof Singh, whose words were filled with wisdom and the experience of a lifetime. He asked us to always keep in mind the name the college is based on  -  Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and I will do so. 

Then came Mr. Maheshinder Singh, a renowned politician and lawyer who taught us the value of hardwork,determination and how we have an opportunity to design our lives. 

Our HOD Harpreet Mam's speech felt so warm, similar to how a mother guides her child. I immensely respect her from my heart.

I was also approached by members of the FM Club for some questions which I glady answered.

This marked the end of the day. I went home content, awaiting the next day.

# Day - 2 :- DEEP INSIGHTS, NEW FACES AND EVALUATION
## 1 August, 2025
Today started off with a warm welcome by Harpreet mam, who told us to settle down, ignore the hustle-bustle and focus on ourselves, and recite any mantra or verse of whatever religion/faith we follow. 

Mrs. Priyadarshini ( a PhD holder in ECE) hosted the first session. She made me realize how little I focused on being _continuously_ happy and rather thought of _excitation_ as real happiness. Also she taught us how we can *choose* to be angry or calm just by changing our perspective, which once I exercised, helped me calm myself down. I found this particular subject quite engrossing.

<img width="280" height="251" alt="Screenshot (59)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73ab3756-8f92-4443-8b27-4e861ed1effd" />


Then came Mr. Arvind Dhingra, who literally woke up all of us again with his energetic and relatable way of talking. The ice-breaker exercise helped me make a new friend.He proceeded with basic overview of all the societies and student chapters present and working in the college. He encouraged everybody to join atleast two for complete and holistic development. The whole session was amazing and we all wished it to be longer. 

The English Proficiency Test went by like a breeze, while the maths one scratched some desolate corners of my brain which made me ponder on my weak memory. Although I did solve most of the questions, some proved to be rather tricky, involving formulas we had already used in the past, but failed to recall at the moment. 

With the tests done, and the question paper in my hand, I walked out of the college's front gate, boarded an auto and reached home, determined to work harder to improve my maths aptitude.

# Day - 3 :- INTRODUCTIONS, SELF INTROSPECTION, INTROS AND MENTORING
## 4 August, 2025
 Even before joining the college, I was very curious about all the clubs and societies here. Today's first session was held by "CAUSMIC CLUB". The speakers shared with us the history of the club, how it came into formation and gave a detailed overview of the various events hosted by the club, APEX and AMBIT YOUTH PARLIAMENT grabbing my attention the most. The _Bhaisaab reel_ was quite funny and showed us how the clubs use various forms of approach to convey their messages and ideas. I might apply for the club once the forms are out.

 Mrs. Priyadarshini's second session was as intriguing as the last one. Everything she spoke felt like was targeted towards me. She understands the youth on deeper level than most speakers. Her views on the indulgence-depression cycle resonated with me. I asked her some of my queries once the session ended, and her answers were extremely helpful. Then I went on to meet some sophomores I personally knew who took me around the campus and shared their experiences with me.

 After the break ended, I headed towards my assigned class room for my first English lecture, which to my surprise was more of a two-way discussion than a traditional lecture. Prof. Nisha asked all of us to introduce ourselves. She complimented me on my confident posture (but deep down I knew I could do better, if only I had more confidence and lesser stage fear). I took note of all her advices and jotted them down. I will surely join the English Club to work on my English Communication Skills which have gotten way worse since the last 2 years.

![photo_2025-08-08_00-24-57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956bd606-2777-480b-9c38-bced8a4a1ee8)


 Next up, we had our first P2P (Peer to Peer) lecture in the same room, for which I brought my laptop too. Our seniors taught us the basics of C++. Although I didn't quite understand the theory part first, but when I ran the code on an online compiler for the first time, it all made sense. I wasnt able to execute the _sum_ function properly though, so asked help from one of the seniors, who gladly helped me and cleared all the doubts.

Today was an amazing and enlightening experience and I look forward for more such instances.

# Day - 4 :- EXPERIENCES SHARED, MOTORSPORTS AND _MAJESTIC_ MILLETS
## 5 August, 2025
The time-table for today's program was quite different and I had to recheck thrice to confirm that I was reading the correct one. We had our first class at 1:30 pm which was a P2P session again, with our senior Manan Sood. It was substantially different from the last one as instead of learning to code, we were given advice on how to make out the best of the upcoming semesters. Manan himself shared his mistakes and advised us to work in a focused and smart way, while taking part in clubs and various activites, managing studies and activities efficiently. He also took all of our queries and answered them. I came to know the college better today.

Next up we went to the auditorium and enjoyed an amazing lecture on _Motorsports_ by Mr. Gautam Murria. I didn't even know that the power saver mode I use on my phone on a daily basis was a result of motorsports innovation. He explained how motorsports requires engineers from each and every branch of engineering. 

![photo_2025-08-08_00-27-00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83124d37-554c-4b30-b4bd-7dfd499858c0)


The program continued with a session by Dr. Shaffy Makkar with her expert lecture on "Millets - A Super Food". I had no idea that I was cooking them the incorrect way. No wonder they couldn't appeal to my taste buds. She showed us the correct method to make them which I noted down to share with my mom. When she was listing and explaining the different types of millets and their respective benefits, _Kutki_ catched my eye since it is beneficial for women over 40 years of age going through menopause, which I intend to cook for my mother. The session was quite eye-opening for me and I cant wait to try millets now. 

# Day - 5 :- AWARENESS, FITNESS, NCC, PHYSICS AND C++
## 6 August, 2025
Today's program's commencement time was bit late than usual i.e. 9:30 instead of 8:30, so I used that extra time to work on this report.

The day kicked off by a lecture by the Dean of Student Welfare - Dr. Parminder Singh, who made us familiar with all the facilities available in the college like computer labs, high speed wifi, swimming pool, emergency medical aid, central library etc. and asked us to utilize them to the fullest. He also warned us against ragging since the college has a very strick Anti-Ragging policy which ensures a healthy and collaborative environment for everyone to grow.

The program proceeded with a lecture from a personality who I greatly admire now - Mr. Manpreet Singh, who is a professional body builder and also the SARPANCH of Manakwal village. Such a contrast in professions led my interest to peak in the lecture, and I was quite amazed by what was coming. He shared with us his story, from rags to success, how his unbreakable will led him through highs and lows. He stressesd on the importance of fitness for us future engineers. Not only that, as a big brother too he made us promise never to get into drug addiction and help out anyone we can. The most interesting part of the session was when he called a bunch of boys to perform push ups on the stage. The whole auditorium, including me were cheering for them. I wish to have the same determination as him and pave my way towards my dream.

What followed next was nothing short of inspiring. Were introduced to the college's NCC wing by one of the Under-Officers. He showed us all the past events, the social media pages and how the NCC has been an integral part of the college's culture. Then we welcomed Brigadier P.S. Cheema Sir with a standing ovation followed by a huge round of applause. He stressed upon the importance of discipline for students and how consistency is must-have skill for the youth to be successful. Before ending, he taught us the 5 F's of success. Then he left the auditorium, addressing us by " Young boys and girls, ALL THE BEST". I aspire to have even 10 percent of the discipline NCC cadets have.

Prof. Jaspreet Singh hosted our first physics lecture. He explained to us the curriculum of first year and how we should study to gain both practical and theoretical knowdledge in the best way possible. Nevertheless, he cleared all my queries regarding the subject in general too.

We had our 3rd P2P lecture after Physics, where seniors continued teaching us C++, this time more advanced topics such as operators, looping and conditional statements. We created more complex codes than last time using all the new knowledge we had gained during today's lecture. Everything was crystal clear. The seniors asked us to prepare for the upcoming P2P exam and wished us all the best.

This ended a hectic day, but my mind was not tired as I got to learn what I want to. Day by day, I move one step closer towards my dream.

# Day - 6 :-  PHYSICS, MATHEMATICS INTRODUCTION, A GLIMPSE OF CML AND OVERVIEW OF NSS
## 7 August, 2025
Unlike the routine I was used to till now of going straight to the auditorium, the day started off with a Physics Lecture by Prof. Jaspreet Singh. We officially started the Semester 1 curriculum by covering basic topics like gradient and learning new operators like delta and laplace. Overall the lecture was really intriguing and I really didn't notice the time pass by. 

We left for our first maths lecture of the term which was hosted by Prof. Sandeep Kaur Gill. She interacted with us, took our doubts and gave us a basic overview our syllabus and showed us the difference between high school and college level mathematics. She also asked a lot of questions which helped us recall earlier done topics. We would be proceeding with _Differential Equations_ once the classes officialy start. 

Next we had a lecture in the auditorium by Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana, incharge of CML. For me personally, this had to be the one of the most fun lectures I ever had. Lakhvir sir has such a fun and outgoing personality which made the lecture way more enjoyable. He explained what CML was, its purpose and how it is different from the rest of the clubs. After that, he taught us how we could study from professors from IITs' without paying a penny using SWAYAM-NPTEL portal, which everybody registered for there only. Even though the lecture extended far longer than the pre-determined time, I wasn't bored for even a second.

The last lecture of the day was hosted by the NSS society of the college. They skipped on the presentations due to limited time, and rather showed us _practically_ what they do, by singing religius hymns in classiccal style. I was mesmerized by both the hymns and the overall environment of the auditorium at that point. The purpose of NSS - _to do something far greater than ourselves_, really appealed to me as a Sikh. I took a picture of the qr code linking to the joining form of the NSS as I plan to join it as soon as possible. They proceeded next with games, comedic skits and reel showcasing which were really entertaining and didn't let out attention wander away even for a second.

# Day - 7 :- WORKSHOP WANDER
## 8 August, 2025
Today was a rather short day, since we only had to come to the institute for 2 hours for visiting workshops. I was assigned the fitting worksop.

![WhatsApp Image 2025-08-10 at 21 13 43_40777d5b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67d5eafb-3ada-44ea-ad0f-17470603d546)

The Sir in charge of the workshop taught us the basic purpose of the workshop, showcased and explained all the tools, machines and how we use them for various purposes. Then he informed us of the basic precautions to take while working there and asked us to buy uniforms for the same. He showed us how we had to create and maintain practical notebooks, and how the marking scheme in the workshop exams worked. After all this, he took our attendance and let us go. It was a really enjoyable and _new_ experience for me as I love workshops  in general and was waiting to visit one!

# Day - 8 :- CANVA BASICS, LASER, ENG. DRAWING AND WORKING IN THE WORKSHOP
## 11 August, 2025
Finally regular classes have begun. But our seniors informed us that the induction has not program ended yet and will continue till 30 August approximately. So I guess I'll have to keep writing the report till then, not that I am complaining. I do like putting my thoughts and experience out somewhere for someone else to read.

The first lecture was supposed to be of mathematics, but was shifted and changed into a P2P class. The seniors taught us the basics of designing on Canva and gave us a task to create a flyer for Athletic Meet. As I didn't bring my laptop, I made it on my phone. Here's what it looks like ->

<img width="1545" height="2000" alt="CAUSMIC CLUB" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/325d6666-c665-4433-8a2d-cea16d3f1b77" />

Next we had our Physics lecture by Randhir Sir. He kick started our syllabus witH  _LASER_ chapter. He taught us the full form of the word LASER, its definition and how it is different from ordinary light. It was an engaging lecture, and sir's relatable jokes kept it entertaining as well.

After it, we had our first Engineering Drawing and Graphics lecture in the room S-203, where Gulraj Sir started with introductions by everybody, then stressed on the importance of drawing in engineering. Since we did not have any of the required equipment, he gave us a list of what to buy and proceeded with teaching Technical Writing.

We also had workshops assigned to us in the time table. So once the break ended, I went straight to the Fitting Workshop, where we did a whole lot of work today. First, we identified and picked a material, measured it up, marked scratches at 50mm, fixed it up in the vice and kept on grinding the axe. Since I had no partner, it was tiring for me , but I stil enjoyed it. After that, all of us took our cut pieces, took filers then again went to grinding on and on to remove every trace of rust and make it stand upright on one of its thinner side which was a very HARD task. I barely managed to do it, but still it wasn't perfect. By the time I completed, 2 hours had passed, so we returned all the tools and went home.

# Day - 9 :-
## 12 August, 2025
Today was quite a rainy day. I reached the college during the heaviest downpour of the day.

Although we had an Economics Lecture, scheduled in the time table, we were informed a night before that we had to reach TCC Seminar Hall to get our ID cards prepared. There my photo was clicked and signature taken. Mrs. Sanjam Kaur took our attendance there only. 

After that, I went straight to Physics Lab for the second lecture.

![WhatsApp Image 2025-08-12 at 10 23 28_48f8db3c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/873e5523-24d0-49e7-9f1d-69956ac7569f)

Randhir Sir taught us the concept of angle of divergence, how lasers are _generally_ non-ideal i.e. _not all rays are parallel, they scatter by a small angle too which is noticeable usually when the screen is placed more than 1m away from the source_. We did the experiment ourselves by forming different groups. I measured the distance between the screen and the source, drew the tangents and measured the sides of the rectangle formed. We then worked on the calculations and got a correct answer too.

We had our first PPS (Programming for Problem Solving) lecture in the Computational Lab of ECE department. Mrs. Maninder Kaur welcomed us, asked us our names, and gave us a rundown of what we had to study in this subject. We started with basic components of computer system. We were introduced to different units of a computer system, various input-output devices and their functions. Personally, it was a recap for me of what I know and had already studied about computers in school till now. It was an amazing class and I look forward to dive deeper in the subject.

# Day - 10 :- 
## 13 August, 2025
Today was such a tiring yet exciting day. The very first two lectures were alloted to workshops. Since I was already working on a job in the fitting workshop, I just went and continued working on it. Afiter a lot more turmoil, I was able to fill out the gap between the set square and my piece. After that I coated its filed side with a marking paste and left it to dry. Once it had dryed, I used a Vernier Height Gauge to mark lines at 48mm by keeping my filed edge as a base, and used a hammer to strike down dots upon the line for better visibilty. Then kept on filing until the period ended. I also helped a batchmate with the earlier process and guided him as he was absent on the previous day. 
After the workshop ended, I went to the designated room for physics lecture. But surprisingly, some other class was already going on there. After standing there for about 10 mins, we were escorted to the Physics Lab , where as soon as we came, were asked to go the another empty room on the same floor to continue the lecture. Finally after all this hustle and bustle, I sat down and focused on the lecture being presented. We went deeper into Planck's Quantum Theory and understood Einstein's contribution improved upon that.

I bought the required stationery for EDG ( Engineering Drawing and Graphics) lecture during the recess and reached the alloted room on time. There Gulraj Sir again gave us a brief summary of Technical Writing.

![WhatsApp Image 2025-08-13 at 20 38 54_fa24901f](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5241bed6-22bc-4246-840c-63641b93685a)

Once it was over, went straight to our graph papers and started working. The 3 hours passed in the blink of an eye while working. I was able to complete the given work really early. Sir also taught us how to operate a drafter, which felt like a blessing, since now I don't have to use a ruler to draw _supposedly_ straight lines anymore. Once everybody was done, Sir let us go and we marched out.
