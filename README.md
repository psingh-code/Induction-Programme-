The most awaited day had come! During these 2 months (June - July), there wasn't a corner of the college's website I hadn't visited. All the insta pages, club sites, everything I could find about my upcoming journey, I had devoured heartily. From getting tense during the admission process to preparing and packing up for the first day, I was ready. I woke up early in the morning, as a matter of habit, but today there was glitter of enthusiasm in my eyes. Waking up wasn't tiring, exciting I'd rather say. What to wear, which turban to tie, I had already decided the night before.

With the blessings of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, my parents, my grandmother and best wishes from my friends and sibling, I left my home, boarded an auto and reached the front gate of the college in under 5 mins. Did I mention that I just lived around 1.5 kms away from the college? Well now you know! I met my school friend there and headed inside. Upon reaching the Gurudwara Sahib we both were in awe at what we saw. The Gurudwara Sahib's shape was peculiar, which we later came to know was designed like a SHIP. This is to illustrate the line " Guru Nanak Naam Jahaz Hai, Chadai So Utre Paar". 

We did Japji Sahib Paath there, listened to the melodious kirtan by the Raagi Jatha, and payed attention to the teachings given by the Granthi Sahib. Then we had Langar and walked over to the auditorium where upon receiving our kits, sat separately with our respective branches. 

Throguh the words of addressal by the Principal Sir, we came to know about the esteemed legacy of the college and how lucky we were to have joined during the ongoing Platinum Jubilee year. Then we were introduced to Ex. Prof Singh, whose words were filled with wisdome and the experience of a lifetime. He asked us to always keep in mind the name the college is based on  -  Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and I will do so. 

Then came Mr. Maheshinder Singh, a renowned politician and lawyer who taught us the value of hardwork,determination and how we have an opportunity to design our lives. 

Our HOD Harpreet Mam's speech felt so warm, similar to how a mother guides her child. I immensely respect her from my heart. 

This marked the end of the day. I went home content, awaiting the next day.

Today started off with a warm welcome by Harpreet mam, who told us to settle down, ignore the hustle-bustle and focus on ourselves, and recite any mantra or verse of whatever religion/faith we follow. 

Mrs. Priyadarshini ( a PhD holder in ECE) hosted the first session. She made me realize how little I focused on being _continuously_ happy and rather thought of _excitation_ as real happiness. Also she taught us how we can *choose* to be angry or calm just by changing our perspective, which once I exercised, helped me calm myself down. I found this particular subject quite engrossing.

Then came Mr. Arvind Dhingra, who literally woke up all of us again with his energetic and relatable way of talking. The ice-breaker exercise helped me make a new friend. The whole session was amazing and we all wished it to be longer. 

The English Proficiency Test went by like a breeze, while the maths one scratched some desolate corners of my brain which made me ponder on my weak memory. Although I did solve most of the questions, some proved to be rather tricky, involving formulas we had already used in the past, but failed to recall at the moment. 

With the tests done, and the question paper in my hand, I walked out of the college's front gate, boarded an auto and reached home, determined to work harder to improve my maths aptitude.

 Even before joining the college, I was very curious about all the clubs and societies here. Today's first session was held by "CAUSMIC CLUB". The speakers shared with us the history of the club, how it came into formation and gave a detailed overview of the various events hosted by the club, APEX and AMBIT YOUTH PARLIAMENT grabbing my attention the most. The _Bhaisaab reel_ was quite funny and showed us how the clubs use various forms of approach to convey their messages and ideas. I might apply for the club once the forms are out.

 Mrs. Priyadarshini's second session was as intriguing as the last one. Everything she spoke felt like was targeted towards me. She understands the youth on deeper level than most speakers. Her views on the indulgence-depression cycle resonated with me. I asked her some of my queries once the session ended, and her answers were extremely helpful. Then I went on to meet some sophomores I personally knew who took me around the campus and shared their experiences with me.

 After the break ended, I headed towards my assigned class room for my first English lecture, which to my surprise was more of a two-way discussion than a traditional lecture. Prof. Nisha asked all of us to introduce ourselves. She complimented me on my confident posture (but deep down I knew I could do better, if only I had more confidence and lesser stage fear). I took note of all her advices and noted them down. I will surely join the English Club to work on my English Communication Skills which have gotten way worse since the last 2 years.
